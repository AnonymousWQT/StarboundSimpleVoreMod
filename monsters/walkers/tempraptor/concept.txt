"raptor"

	A JP movie style velociraptor;
	Bipedal, arms, claws on feet and hands, big maw dinosaur!

Behaviour is environment dependant:

	If not attacked

		Will walk about, and likely attack anything that is food

		May keep it's distance from NPC's and Players, unsure of them

		May approach and lick players or NPC's (giving wet status)

			-> This is a friendly gesture. NPC/Player can interact with monster to "pet" it?

			<- It may do a friendly vore in this case

	If attacked

		If Empty

			Raptor is now in attack mode, and will run left and right
			Stops to pounce with claws forward, has a chance to "pin" targets (eat them)
				-> Devours target
				Depending on if they were the attacker and such
			Quick bites anyone close on enemy team
			Also has a big chomp move, to devour target

		If Full
			Until attacked while full, raptor will lay on prey and digest it
			-> You can interact with the raptor (if you did not attack it) from outside, if you do
				Belly rubs means the raptor does not digest its prey
			-> If you were the attacker, it bites at you while full
			
			Raptor may be capable of running away while full
				-> Tail swish is an attack that hurts
				-> If attacked, it might vomit it's prey early
