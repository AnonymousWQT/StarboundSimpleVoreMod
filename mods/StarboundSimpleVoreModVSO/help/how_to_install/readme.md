# Installing Starbound Vore Mod Documentation

Download the release, extract the folders into mods. You may have to delete existing folders (to avoid SSVM duplicates)

## Download

First, go to the official github

https://github.com/Sheights/StarboundSimpleVoreMod

Then click on "releases"

![Alt text](github_where_to_click_releases.png?raw=true "Where to get releases")

You should see a .zip or tar.gz file you can download (prefer .zip for windows)

![Alt text](github_download_a_release_package.png?raw=true "Where to download release")

Click that link to download the .zip (Do not "open" just download it)

At this point it is saved either in your Downloads folder or where you told it to download to.

![Alt text](some_browsers_be_like.png?raw=true "Browser downloads")

Make sure you know where that file is! (your browser sometimes lets you drag or double click that file in it's downloads list)

## Locate mods folder

Example steam paths:

	C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\

Once you locate your Starbound folder, there should be a folder "mods" in it.
	
![Alt text](showing_folder_structure.png?raw=true "Showing Folder Structure")

You may have many mods in here! We tried to add a prefix for the new stuff (SSVM and SSVMSPOV) to make it easier to separate them.

## Extract into mods folder

Now you have downloaded the mods/mod pack, and you have located your mods folder.

![Alt text](you_have_located_both.png?raw=true "Downloaded mod and mods folder")

You can extract the zip into the mods folder, or drag and drop

![Alt text](extractions_well_ok.png?raw=true "Extracting mod")

Your end result folders should look like

![Alt text](showing_folder_structure.png?raw=true "Showing Folder Structure")

Of course all your other mods can stay.

# Hooray, you have installed the mod!

## Problems

Sometimes, mod incompatibility will destroy universes and players.

Defend yourself by backing up your storage folder! (send your storage folder to a .zip / compress it as a backup)

Additionally, if you want to experiment safely with new mod configurations, rename your mods folder and make a new one to experiment with.

Then, if something goes wrong, you can delete the storage folder and restore your backup into it, and just swap the name of the mods folders around.

This is how we tested compatibility with some complicated mods

![Alt text](experimenting_with_mods.png?raw=true "Renaming mods, backing up storage")

Somtimes you need to delete the existing folders

Windows sometimes doubles up folders if you right click / extract here, so check for that

IF something crashes, we need the .log file to help you (will not help if you dont provide a .log)

### Dangerous Beta Releases

If you want to live on the edge (bugs, possible universe/character deletion) just click the "Clone or download" button and download the current master.
