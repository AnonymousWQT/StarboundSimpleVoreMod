Ritual Obelisk

"An obelisk pulsing with energy, fit for summoning spiritual creatures, surrounded by the materials to summon a Bunyip. 

Apex: "The energy from this stone makes my hair prickle...What is this?"
Avian: "...I don't think I'm comfortable with rituals like this, even if it does summon powerful beings..."
Floran: "Free fish!"
Glitch: "Analytic: Obelisk appears Gielinorian in origin. There is a raw shark and some other odd trinkets at its base."
Human: "Okay...If one has to sacrifice something as scary as a shark for this...What is it going to summon...?"
Hylotl: "An ignoble end for such a fierce predator...What is this going to lead to?"
Novakid: "I'm not goin' to even pretend I know how this hoodoo-voodoo stuff works."
