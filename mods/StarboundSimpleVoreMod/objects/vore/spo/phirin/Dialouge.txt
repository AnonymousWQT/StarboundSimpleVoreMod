Apex: "He seems to be leering at me in a dominant way...despite how small he is."
Avian: "This creature doesn't seem to want to sit still..."
Floran: "Sharkyfishlizard is interesting..."
Glitch: "Species Match confirmed - Phirin. Seems docile, if a bit dominant."
Human:  "If there's two things sharks didn't need, it's legs and a dominant streak."

Apex: "This creature seems to exude an air of dominant confidence...I don't think I should give him a chance to act on it."
Avian: "Okay...I'm really not a fan of a fish that bites back."
Floran: "Sharkylizard keeps glaring at me..."
Glitch: "Species Match confirmed - Phirin. Concern. Shark and lizard physiology in the same place is probably not a good thing." 
Human: "...Because sharks weren't dangerous enough. "Oh, let's get some lizard in there too, it'll be great!" " 
Hylotl: "Okay. No. No no no. I know what sharks do to fish. I know where this is going."
Novakid: "Whoa, buddy, that's a look that could burn a hole in the ship. Chill out."
