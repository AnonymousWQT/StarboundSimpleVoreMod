1. Installation
*************************************************************

	Installation is no different with this mod than there is
	with any other. Simply copy and paste the folder
	containing everything to your mods directory which is
	located at: "steamapps\common\Starbound\giraffe_storage".
	The *.modinfo file must be at the root of the mod so that
	"mods\StarboundSimpleVore\StarboundSimpleVore.modinfo" is
	a valid path.
	
*************************************************************
2. Accessing Content
*************************************************************
	A. The Bellybound Store
	*********************************************************
	
	All content in this mod is accessable one way or another
	through our main form of distribution, the Bellybound
	Store. The store may be crafted by the player by pressing
	'c' to open up the player crafting menu and then
	selecting one of the two varients.
	
	The first is our original Bellybound store. It is quite
	bulky and large. The store is animated and has lines
	depending on the player's proximity. The second varient
	is the small holographic store. The holographic store
	takes up almost an imcomparable amount of space and has
	access to all the freatures the primary store has.
	
	*********************************************************
	B. Placable Predator Objects
	*********************************************************
	
	The placable predator objects were the first feature of
	the USSV. They are all purchasable from the Bellybound
	stores and come in a vast selection. The predators are
	organized by rarity and also some have tags. Static preds
	that consist of two frames, an empty and a full, are
	of 'common' rarity, which means they have a white border.
	Animated preds are 'uncommon' rarity and have a green
	border. When entering a pred they usually function as a
	bed healing the user, but preds with the keyword
	"Hungry" or preds with the tag [Digestion] will harm
	them. Animated preds with the [Digestion] tag will have
	special animations depending on the health of the user.
	Additional tags you can search for are: [CV]
	
	*********************************************************
	C. Furniture
	*********************************************************
	
	Bellybound also sells vore-themed furniture indicated by
	the purple border, or 'legendary' rarity. All of these
	objects do not specially interact with the player, but do
	carry a special 'tag' for the tenant system (See the next
	section for more information.) All furniture has the a
	'vore' tag associated with it.

	*********************************************************
	D. NPCs
	*********************************************************
	
	The USSV mod also offers a unique form of content in NPCs
	and tenants. Each of our special tenants has the
	unique ability to seemingly consume the player and other
	NPCs around them. To summon one of these NPCs you need
	to build them a room. The room must be a closed
	environment including background. It must also contain at
	least the required tags in tiles. Each item at least one
	tag associated with it. Every tile it takes up in game
	counts as one tile torwards the requirements. NPCs
	summoned with the 'vore' tag will not harm the player
	while NPCs summoned with the 'dvore' tag will digest
	their prey. Refer to the table below for all available
	tenants and their required tags. The '(D)Vore' tag means
	either a 'vore' tag, or a 'dvore' tag can be used. All of
	this can be explained in more detail if you research the
	colony/tenant system.

	Required Mods to access NPCs:
	Avali: Avali Triage
	Lucario: Lucario Race
	Lopunny: Lopunny Race and Lopunny Improvements
	
	You may also interact with our NPCs by pressing 'e' twice
	quickly. This will allow you to "request" to be eaten.
	In this state you may stay as long as you want. For UB
	preds, you will only be stuck in an egg if you stay
	for atleast the normal duration of the non-forced
	version. You will digest at the normal rate for fatal
	NPCs. To leave an NPC, requested or no, interact twice
	quickly again. This will make any normal NPC void them
	selves of their prey (even if you arn't it) but preds
	with increased capacity require you to to actually be
	one of their victims.
	
	NPCs include a few configuration options that can be made
	by viewing "/scripts/vore/npcvore.lua" or
	"/scripts/vore/multivore.lua". You may open .lua files
	with any text editor like Notepad. Lua files are what are
	called "scripts" and don't need to be compiled. The
	config sections are defined clearly at the top as well as
	what values are appropriate. Change the value to fit your
	needs and save the document to apply changes.
	
	Under normal circumstances predators will not eat players
	located on a player ship. Players are invincible on their
	ships to prevent griefing. If you wish to take a starry
	flight from the comfort of your favorite belly you must
	disable this invincibility. You are able to do this in
	both config sections. The option is disabled by default.
	Enabling this option and summoning an NPC to your ship
	will disable all player invincibility on that particular
	ship until you set it back. I will not provide a method
	of doing this, as it can be used to make entire planets
	sanctuary.
	
	*********************************************************
	E. RP Tool
	*********************************************************
	
	Avaiable at the bellybound store is a "Vore Tech Chip".
	Buying it will enable a tech you may select at your
	ship's AI center. This tech is centered around the prey
	for role playing. Place your cursor over your potential
	player pred and press F. You will turn invisible and
	follow the subject. Press F again to return. There are
	no bellies or sounds currently. You may improvise with
	assets found in the mod or make your own. Check the
	contributions section for more help on the matter.
	(I havn't written it yet but whatever.)
