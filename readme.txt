1. Installation
*************************************************************

	Installation is no different with this mod than there is
	with any other. Simply copy and paste the folder
	containing everything to your mods directory which is
	located at: "steamapps\common\Starbound\giraffe_storage".
	The *.modinfo file must be at the root of the mod so that
	"mods\StarboundSimpleVore\StarboundSimpleVore.modinfo" is
	a valid path.
	
	This mod has no dependencies, however to access all
	content you will need the Avali Traige mod. You may find
	it at "http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/avali-triage.2852/"
	
*************************************************************
2. Accessing Content
*************************************************************
	A. The Bellybound Store
	*********************************************************
	
	All content in this mod is accessable one way or another
	through our main form of distribution, the Bellybound
	Store. The store may be crafted by the player by pressing
	'c' to open up the player crafting menu and then
	selecting one of the two varients.
	
	The first is our original Bellybound store. It is quite
	bulky and large. The store is animated and has lines
	depending on the player's proximity. The second varient
	is the small holographic store. The holographic store
	takes up almost an imcomparable amount of space and has
	access to all the freatures the primary store has.
	
	*********************************************************
	B. Placable Predator Objects
	*********************************************************
	
	The placable predator objects were the first feature of
	the USSV. They are all purchasable from the Bellybound
	stores and come in a vast selection. The predators are
	organized by rarity and also some have tags. Static preds
	that consist of two frames, an empty and a full, are
	of 'common' rarity, which means they have a white border.
	Animated preds are 'uncommon' rarity and have a green
	border. When entering a pred they usually function as a
	bed healing the user, but preds with the keyword
	"Hungry" or preds with the tag [Digestion] will harm
	them. Animated preds with the [Digestion] tag will have
	special animations depending on the health of the user.
	Additional tags you can search for are: [CV]
	
	*********************************************************
	C. Furniture
	*********************************************************
	
	Bellybound also sells vore-themed furniture indicated by
	the purple border, or 'legendary' rarity. All of these
	objects do not specially interact with the player, but do
	carry a special 'tag' for the tenant system (See the next
	section for more information.) All furniture has the
	'vore' tag with the exception of "Emerald Vorb",
	"Comsumption" perfume bottle, and "Fed Mimic", which all
	have the 'dvore' tag which does something different.
	
	*********************************************************
	D. NPCs
	*********************************************************
	
	The USSV mod also offers a unique form of content in NPCs
	and tenants. Each of our 8 special tenants has the
	unique ability to seemingly consume the player and other
	NPCs around them. To summon one of these NPCs you need
	to build them a room. The room must be a closed
	environment including background. It must also contain at
	least the required tags in tiles. Each item at least one
	tag associated with it. Every tile it takes up in game
	counts as one tile torwards the requirements. NPCs
	summoned with the 'vore' tag will not harm the player
	while NPCs summoned with the 'dvore' tag will digest
	their prey. Refer to the table below for all available
	tenants and their required tags. The '(D)Vore' tag means
	either a 'vore' tag, or a 'dvore' tag can be used.
