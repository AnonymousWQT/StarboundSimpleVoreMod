	"My name is Rasmir and I'm a hibani. For anybody who doesn't know who we are, we're a species that come from a planet we call Stoborhanq, with long ears, hair, fur, big legs and good physical strength. ",
	
	"I learned we are hybrids from two already extinct species whose names I never learned. ",
	
	"Sadly, we have no registry from our origins; our registries start just some centuries ago, when we were already a dominant species in our own planet. ",
	
	"Our planet was becoming small, and we're a predatory species. We were already learning to fly into space, and we were forced by our situation to expand to neighbor planets. Our method of invasion was fairly simple. We ate other species, and we protected these lesser species from their enemies. They developed a kind of symbiotic relationship, allowing us to consume them as food, but also accepting that without us they'd be completely destroyed.",
	
	"While our conquest of space started nice, soon problems inside our own species, including traitors, greedy leaders, and despots that just wanted more and more power forced some of us to leave. We continued invading other planets, but we got divided in two sides.",
	
	"One side of our species agreed with our (bad) leaders, and the other side was against and ran away. ",
	
	"Still, it's nothing extremely mean for visitors. Most of us are relaxed, nice and gentle if you don't do anything against us. Be careful, of course, because it wouldn't be strange if one or two of us decided you look delicious and you became nothing more than space food. I don't know if you want to end your days and adventures inside one of us. Who knows. Maybe you would."
