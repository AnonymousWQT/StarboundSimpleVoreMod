    "Adventurers are always being sent out by the Adventure Guild this way and that, so when you were sent out on a mission to a far off existance by the Mages, into some strange flying ship in the stars it was odd for sure, but not the strangest your rodenty self had faced in the name of Adventuring.",

    "The mission seemed pretty stright forward. use the fancy guns on the ship to shoot some big rock that had a monster on it before it reached a planet. Easy peasy, you made your way there and pepared a nice cup of tea for when you were done.",
	
	"On reaching Earth, things went downhill fast. You expected the Humans to be confused by a Rodent, rare in these parts, flying a space ship all the way to Earth, not Earth to be infested with tentacles.",

	"The panicked comms chatter confirmed that indeed, you were a little too late to do anything to stop the beast from making planetfall and right now all that could be done is engage the horror like many others or flee.",
	
	"The next big mistake made was getting the beast angry with your ships little guns. Sure, they managed to make parts of a single tentacle charred, but it sure got it's attention.",
	
	"After thwacking a ship larger then yours right out of the sky, a tentacle showed you what it was like to be a cricket ball when batting a six.",
	
	"Goodness only knows how long you've drifted in the broken ship, or if you were towed away to safety, or how long you were knocked out. But you sure arn't near Earth anymore.",
	
	"What's worse, the tea is all spilt... "
