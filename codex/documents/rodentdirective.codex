    "Dear Adventure Scout,
The Adventure Guild has reviewed your actions regarding the Human Monster issue, and have decided to absolve you of all responcability, as the ship you were flying had no real way of reaching Earth in time. your actions, though rash, were heroic enough to damage the ship and aquit yourself",

    "However, the subsequent spilling of tea and cracking of antique fine china is unforgivable, and you are hereby banished from the Adventure Guild. We will forgo placing this on your official record due to the situation involved. 
You may keep the ship, or rather what is left of it.",

	"All the best."
